The Psychedelic Society of Kansas City is a vibrant community that explores the transformative potential of psychedelic medicine, art, and culture. We believe in fostering thoughtful conversations and connections around these emerging fields while advocating for informed, responsible use and supporting efforts to expand awareness and access.

Join us for our monthly meetups, where we gather to share knowledge, spark inspiration, and engage with the latest developments in the world of psychedelics. Each event features a keynote speaker—ranging from drug policy experts to visionary artists—who will illuminate topics such as cutting-edge science, legislative updates, and the integration of psychedelics into health and culture.

Whether you’re a curious newcomer, a seasoned advocate, or a passionate artist, the Psychedelic Society of Kansas City offers a welcoming space to connect, learn, and grow. Together, we’re building a community that supports innovation, creativity, and healing in Kansas City and beyond.
