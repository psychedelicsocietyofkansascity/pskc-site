## Who We Are
The Psychedelic Society of Kansas City (PSKC) is a community-driven organization dedicated to fostering education, dialogue, and connection around the transformative potential of psychedelics. Our members come from all walks of life—clinical researchers, artists, therapists, educators, and curious explorers—united by an interest in the beneficial use and responsible integration of these tools into society.

## Our Mission
Founded in 2024, PSKC aims to provide a safe, inclusive space where people can learn about psychedelic medicine, share their personal stories, and exchange ideas about the rapidly evolving fields of research and clinical applications. By bringing together diverse voices & perspectives, we hope to break down stigma and support evidence-based practices that promote healing, creativity, and cultural enrichment.

## What We Do
- **Monthly Meetups:** We gather monthly to hear keynote speakers present on topics like the latest clinical trials, current events in psychedelic policy, innovative art projects, and emerging opportunities in Kansas City. These gatherings also offer space for open discussion, networking, and community building.
- **Educational Resources:** We strive to share reliable, up-to-date information about psychedelics, from clinical breakthroughs to historical context, through our blog posts, newsletters, and social media channels.
- **Community Engagement:** Our group is committed to serving the broader Kansas City community by hosting workshops, collaborating with local artists and healthcare providers, and organizing events that promote education and awareness.
